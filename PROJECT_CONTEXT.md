# Project Context: The Story Behind Notion ACTION Items Extractor

## The Original Problem

When managing multiple projects in a Notion kanban board, a common workflow pattern emerged: team members would naturally write ACTION items inline with their project updates. For example, a typical kanban card might contain notes like this:

```
11/4
- Created a PR
- Waiting on approval from owner

11/18
- Fixed linting
- Still waiting on approval

12/17
- Reached out to a maintainer but no response
ACTION: Reach out to another maintainer
ACTION: Schedule follow-up meeting with team
```

While this organic note-taking style felt natural, it created several significant problems:

**Scattered Action Items:** Important tasks were buried within project notes across dozens of kanban cards, making it nearly impossible to get a comprehensive view of all pending work.

**Missed Deadlines:** Without a centralized tracking system, action items would often be forgotten or overlooked, especially when cards moved between different kanban columns.

**No Completion Tracking:** There was no efficient way to mark action items as complete while maintaining the connection to their original context.

**Manual Overhead:** The only alternative was manually copying action items to a separate task management system, which was time-consuming and error-prone.

## Automated Workflow Solution

The system operates on a simple but powerful principle: it continuously monitors your Notion kanban database for cards containing "ACTION:" items and maintains a synchronized Master Action Items database.

**Detection Phase:** The system queries your kanban database for any cards containing "ACTION:" text in their Notes field, using Notion's built-in search capabilities to efficiently filter relevant cards.

**Smart Processing:** For each candidate card, the system compares the last edited timestamp with the last processed timestamp to determine if new action items might have been added since the previous run.

**Text Extraction:** Using carefully crafted regular expressions, the system parses the rich text content to extract individual ACTION items, handling various formatting scenarios including bullet points, line breaks, and mixed formatting.

**Duplicate Prevention:** Before creating new action items, the system checks the Master Action Items database to see what items already exist for each source card, ensuring that only genuinely new items are added.

**Bidirectional Sync:** When action items are marked complete in the Master Action Items database, the system updates the original kanban card notes with âœ… indicators, providing visual feedback without disrupting the original note structure.

## Notion Database Setup Requirements

To implement this solution, your Notion workspace needs two properly configured databases:

**Kanban Database Configuration:** Your existing kanban board needs minimal modifications. The system requires a "Notes" rich text field where team members write their updates and ACTION items. Additionally, you need to add a "Last Processed" date field that the system uses to track when each card was last analyzed for action items. An optional "Last Edited Time" field can provide additional timestamp precision, though the system can fall back to Notion's automatic last_edited_time metadata.

**Master Action Items Database Setup:** This new database serves as your centralized action item tracker. It requires an "Action Item" title field to store the extracted task text, a "Status" checkbox field to track completion, a "Source Card" relation field that links back to the originating kanban card, and a "Date Added" timestamp to track when items were created. Optional enhancements include a "Kanban Status" rollup field that shows the current status of the source card.

## Production Automation

The solution includes GitHub Actions configuration for fully automated operation. The system runs three times daily at 9 AM, 1 PM, and 5 PM Eastern Time, ensuring that action items are processed regularly throughout the workday without requiring manual intervention.

**Security Considerations:** All sensitive credentials including Notion API tokens and database IDs are stored as GitHub repository secrets, following security best practices for automated workflows.

**Monitoring and Maintenance:** Comprehensive logging provides visibility into the system's operation, making it easy to troubleshoot issues or understand processing patterns over time.

## Real-World Impact

This automation transforms a manual, error-prone process into a reliable system that scales effortlessly. Team members can continue their natural note-taking habits while gaining the benefits of centralized action item tracking. The bidirectional sync ensures that completion status flows back to the original context, maintaining the connection between tasks and their project origins.

The solution demonstrates how custom automation can solve workflow problems that existing tools cannot address, particularly when dealing with the nuanced requirements of knowledge work and team collaboration in modern productivity platforms.
